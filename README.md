An exercise exploring python operators and data types

This repository contains a few files that you will need to alter to complete the assignment. The instructions for the exercise are also on Canvas.

Comments in Python are marked by a # sign (for single-line comments) or three matching quotation marks (''' or """) if a comment requires more than one line. They should also appear in a different color in VS Code. The Python Interpreter ignores comments, so you can safely include any information you want there.

As with your assignments, please edit the LICENSE file (replace the [year] [fullname] with the current year and your name); you will also be expected to edit README.md (this file) to describe what you have accomplished.

As always, Fork this repository, and then Clone it to your local computer.

For this exercise, you will need to edit main.py. The file is broken into many functions (def blocks), each of which is designed to perform a basic operation. Many of these are arithmetic, some work with lists or strings, and others produce random values.

To help you along, I have implemented the add function. Also, here are a few online resources that might be useful:

 * [Python operators](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm)
 * [Python built-in data types](https://realpython.com/python-data-types/)
 * [The Python slice operator](https://techwithtim.net/tutorials/python-programming/beginner-python-tutorials/slice-operator/)
 * [The Python Random Module](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/random/how-to-use-the-random-module-in-python)
 * [Python lists](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp)

 As always, commit and push your changes to GitHub, and then turn in the URL to your repository on Canvas.

* [1 point] Repository contains an appropriate software license
* [1 point] Repository contains a descriptive README.md
* [8] Accomplishes the objective of the exercise
